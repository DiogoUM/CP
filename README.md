# CP

This project was made in Haskell in order to pursue an evaluation in CÃ¡lculo de Programas (CP) of university course.

It consisted in resolving 4 problems in which we, me and my group collegue, had to aply all the knowledge that we had achieved in such class. 
Such knowledge is based on how to create a computing program in the most eficient way possible, not forgetting its corretion. To achieve this goal we learned to 
analize and ratiocinate about the program itself. For this we didn't focus on the technological aspects of programming, instead we focused in the methodological
rigor in order to build quality software. Doing so we achieved a 19 grade out of 20.

Both the problems and its resolution, including a detailed explanation of each one, can be found in the file named "cp2122t.pdf", which was made in LaTex.
